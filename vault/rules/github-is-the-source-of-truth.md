# GitHub is the source of truth

Never trust a locally-cached or previously-read copy of a hub file across
sessions. Before editing or publishing anything in `hubs/*/index.html` or
`widget/`:

1. Fetch the file fresh from `main` (raw GitHub content, not a cached Read/Artifact
   snapshot from an earlier turn) and diff it against whatever you were about to
   publish over it.
2. If it changed since your working copy's common ancestor, don't blind-overwrite.
   Do a real three-way merge (`git merge-file -p <mine> <ancestor> <theirs>`),
   then check the result for conflict markers with a line-anchored pattern
   (`^<<<<<<<`, `^=======$`, `^>>>>>>>`) — this file's own CSS uses long `====`
   dividers as comments, which false-positive on a naive substring search.
3. After merging, verify before publishing: `node --check` on the extracted
   `<script>` block, structural counts (question/lecture/drug counts match what
   you expect), a duplicate-id check, a check that the feature you were adding
   is actually present, and ideally a live smoke test (Playwright or the browser
   pane) before it goes out.
4. Check the change log ("Recent major changes" in `DEPLOY_NOTES.md`) **and** the site's own changelog (Supabase
   `changelog` table, shown on the dashboard) for anything recent before you
   deploy — if someone else's change isn't reflected in your working copy yet,
   that's your signal to go back to step 1.

Claude Code sessions (and any agent that can use git) do this with `git fetch` and a rebase onto `origin/main`:
[ship-a-change](../how-to/ship-a-change.md).
