# Deploy Notes — read this before touching the repo

This repo is edited from several different Claude Projects (one per hub, plus a
"hub index" / overarching project for cross-hub UI and shared functionality).
Those Projects don't share context with each other or with plain Claude Code
sessions — a session in one Project has no idea what a session in another
Project just changed. **This file is the one place every session, regardless
of which Project spawned it, can check.** Update it whenever you make a
non-trivial change, and read it before you deploy.

## The core rule: GitHub is the source of truth

Never trust a locally-cached or previously-read copy of a hub file across
sessions. Before editing or publishing anything in `hubs/*/index.html` or
`widget/`:

1. Fetch the file fresh from `main` (raw GitHub content, not a cached Read/Artifact
   snapshot from an earlier turn) and diff it against whatever you were about to
   publish over it.
2. If it changed since your working copy's common ancestor, don't blind-overwrite.
   Do a real three-way merge (`git merge-file -p <mine> <ancestor> <theirs>`),
   then check the result for conflict markers with a line-anchored pattern
   (`^<<<<<<<`, `^=======$`, `^>>>>>>>`) — this file's own CSS uses long `====`
   dividers as comments, which false-positive on a naive substring search.
3. After merging, verify before publishing: `node --check` on the extracted
   `<script>` block, structural counts (question/lecture/drug counts match what
   you expect), a duplicate-id check, a check that the feature you were adding
   is actually present, and ideally a live smoke test (Playwright or the browser
   pane) before it goes out.
4. Check the entries below **and** the site's own changelog (Supabase
   `changelog` table, shown on the dashboard) for anything recent before you
   deploy — if someone else's change isn't reflected in your working copy yet,
   that's your signal to go back to step 1.

## Shared infrastructure (touch once, not per-hub)

- **`widget/v3.js` + `widget/v3.css`** — loaded by every hub (`fixed-pros`,
  `genetics`, `gi-exam1`, `hepatobiliary`, `perio`) via
  `<script src="../../widget/v3.js" data-hub="<hub-id>" data-answered-event="<hub>:answered" data-default-mode="...">`.
  Cross-hub functionality (search, class-wide correctness, streaks, activity
  pulse, leaderboard, analytics) belongs here — never hand-patched into one
  hub's own `index.html`. Each hub publishes `window.SH_EXPORT =
  {lectures, questions}` after its own IIFE closes, which is what the widget
  reads for search and "toughest questions" — if you add a hub or change its
  question shape, make sure `SH_EXPORT` still reflects it.
- **Supabase project `thytmzsgymydbzcqdnix`** backs the widget: changelog,
  leaderboard, study streaks, activity pulse, and visitor analytics (see
  `migration_v4.sql`/`v5.sql`/`v6.sql` at repo root for schema history — run
  new migrations once each, by hand, in the Supabase SQL editor). The API key
  and the `log_changelog`/admin RPC secret live only in local ops scripts on
  Sam's machine (`deploy_rollout.ps1`, `check_leaderboard.ps1`) — **never**
  commit them here or hardcode them into a hub's client-side JS.
- **GitHub Pages deploy** — `github.com/smcmurry6-source/study-hubs`, branch
  `main`, served at `smcmurry6-source.github.io/study-hubs/`. Deploy via the
  GitHub Git Data API (blob → tree → commit → ref update); a GitHub PAT is
  needed for this and should only ever be used transiently (env var for one
  script run), never written into a committed file.

## Recent major changes (newest first — add a line when you ship something)

- **2026-09-23** — New hub: `hubs/msk-exam3/` ("Musculoskeletal Exam 3 Hub", widget
  `data-hub="msk-exam3"`, event `msk3:answered`, localStorage `msk3-state-v1`),
  built from the GI 3 Claude Project (L19-L27; L26 drugs and L27 tumors are
  slides-only until their recordings are uploaded). Modes: Compendium, Review
  (grouped reference: drugs, hormones, cells, matrix, genes, diseases, tumors,
  processes, superlatives; with a recall/blur toggle), and an Arcade that
  REPLACES the illustrated-scene game pattern at Sam's request: three
  cool-math-games-style mini games (Sort Storm, Osteo Snake, Stack Attack).
  Osteo Snake answers go through the normal answered event, so they count in
  class stats. Hub source is built from split files (css/js) in that Project's
  session; the deployed `index.html` is the single-file build. Added the hub to
  the dashboard GI group, `HUB_LABEL`/`ALL_HUBS`, and `review/` `HUB_LABEL`.

- **2026-09-18** — Tactical nuke: raised the streak requirement from 50 to
  100 correct answers in a row, per request. Also replaced the generic
  "Someone has called in a tactical strike" banner with the visitor's
  actual resolved name — the same deterministic name (e.g. "Gleaming
  Molar") the leaderboard and nuke/streak analytics already fall back to
  when a visitor hasn't set a custom display name, instead of a generic
  placeholder word. Added `get_display_name(p_visitor)` (`migration_v9.sql`,
  public, no secret) so the client can resolve it once on load; degrades
  gracefully back to "Someone" if the RPC isn't reachable.

- **2026-09-18** — Wired up analytics that had been silently no-op-ing:
  `widget/v3.js` was already calling `record_nuke_launch` on every tactical-
  nuke strike (since the feature shipped 2026-09-17), but the backing
  Supabase table/function never existed, so every call failed silently and
  the review page showed nothing. `migration_v8.sql` adds `nuke_launches` +
  `record_nuke_launch`/`get_nuke_summary`/`get_nuke_by_hub`/`get_nuke_recent`,
  and a new "Tactical nuke" section on the review page (launches, unique
  launchers, by hub, recent activity). Also added persisted correct-answer
  streak tracking (`correct_streaks` table + `record_correct_streak`, called
  from the same answered-question handler as `record_answer` — separate from
  the in-page-only counter that gates the nuke badge, which still resets on
  reload by design) and `get_correct_streak_stats()` (public, no secret,
  same pattern as `get_leaderboard`) showing the longest streak currently
  still standing and the all-time record. Shown in two places per request:
  a "Correct-answer streaks" section on the review page, and a matching
  card on the public dashboard (`index.html`) next to Study Streaks.

- **2026-09-16** — Perio: Session 3 (Risk Assessment, Dr. Geisinger) ingested
  from its lecture recording transcript + slide deck — flipped from
  exam-review-guide-only to fully lectured (new reading, 2 reference tables,
  17 new lecture-sourced questions, rewritten cram-sheet entry and mind map).
  Session 2 (Incisions/Flaps/Sutures) enriched with a supplementary in-class
  Q&A transcript (sub-marginal incisions, flap-thickness-by-procedure,
  palatal graft harvesting) — 9 new questions, 1 new incision type, 1 new
  reference table, 3 new exam hints. Question bank grew from 124 to 150.
  Regenerated Kokoro narration (`audio/risk-assessment-full.mp3`,
  `audio/incisions-flaps-sutures-full.mp3`) to match, per the
  text-and-audio-must-not-drift rule above. Also fixed two pre-existing bugs
  surfaced by testing against the larger bank (neither introduced by this
  content work — both date from the earlier Game-mode/gameplay-progress-split
  change, and both are general fixes in the shared `qCardHTML`/
  `wireQuestionContainer` pattern, not perio-specific): `recordGameAnswer`
  never dispatched the event the cutscene-trigger listener watches for, so
  clearing a lecture by actually playing through Understory never played its
  reward cutscene; and `SEQ_STATE`/`MATCH_STATE` (sequence/match
  click-tracking) were keyed globally by question id instead of per-render,
  so a sequence or match question could only ever be completed once per page
  load, in whichever mode/view reached it first — re-encountering the same
  question in a second context (Question Bank, then a Game encounter)
  silently could never be completed there. Worth checking other hubs that
  share this rendering pattern for the same two issues.

- **2026-09-16** — Added data-driven lecture mind maps: a new shared
  `window.shMindMap.render()` renderer in `widget/v3.js` (generic
  hierarchical tree layout, inline SVG, horizontally scrollable) plus a
  `MINDMAPS` data object per hub (10 hepatobiliary lectures, 9 perio
  sessions, content grounded in each hub's own lecture notes/reading
  text). A "Show mind map" toggle now appears under the lecture-notes
  reading pane in both hubs, following the same shared-renderer/
  hub-local-data pattern as `shGetClassStats`/`qCardHTML` — a future hub
  only needs its own `MINDMAPS` object, not new rendering code. Also
  fixed a spacing bug in the renderer itself: `layout()` was assigning
  leaf rows a fixed height while `nodeBoxHTML()` sized each box to its
  actual wrapped-line count, so any 2-3-line label produced a box taller
  than its row and visually spilled into the node below it. **Follow-up
  fix, same day:** the first deploy of this feature shipped
  `widget/v3.js` and both hub HTML files but forgot `widget/v3.css` —
  the mind maps went live as unstyled black SVG silhouettes (no fill/
  stroke/font rules) until a second deploy an hour later added the
  missing CSS file. Lesson: when a change touches both `widget/v3.js`
  and `widget/v3.css`, double-check FILES in `deploy_rollout.py`
  includes both before running it — it's easy to edit both files and
  only remember to list one.

- **2026-09-16** — Hub index: integrated the universal back button into each
  live hub's own sticky ribbon instead of a separate fixed bar above it
  (perio, hepatobiliary); removed a redundant duplicate background-music
  system inside Hepatobiliary's own Lounge panel; converted all 60
  originally free-recall questions in the archived GI Exam 1 question bank
  (question-banks/gi1-question-bank.json) to multiple-choice with curated
  distractors, so all 89 GI1 questions are now MCQ, and expanded
  Hepatobiliary Mock Exam's embedded EXAM1_REVIEW_POOL from a 27-question
  curated subset to the full 89.


- **2026-09-15** — Hepatobiliary: GI Pharmacology + Clinical Applications for
  Dentistry lecture transcripts mined into Lecture Notes/Exam Hints/Questions
  (now 10/10 lectures, 363 questions), reconciled via 3-way merge with a
  parallel session's Active Recall tab + `widget/v3.js` integration work,
  republished to the Claude Artifact and deployed to GitHub Pages.
- **2026-09-12** *(approx, from widget history)* — Active Recall flashcard
  mode added (hide-and-reveal cards pulled from Cram Sheet/reference content,
  deliberately excluding direct-quote Exam Hints cards since a raw quote makes
  a weak recall prompt); `widget/v3.js` v3 rollout across all 5 hubs.
- **2026-09-09** *(approx, from Supabase changelog)* — Study streaks, live
  class activity pulse, opt-in leaderboard, question flag/suggest-fix; search
  across every hub; class-wide correctness shown automatically; Listen
  (text-to-speech) button with word-by-word highlighting; mobile redesign.

This list is intentionally short — it's an orientation aid, not a full
changelog (that's the Supabase `changelog` table / dashboard "What's New"
box) or a per-hub history (that's each hub's own manifest doc, kept in its
Claude Project).

## Why this file exists

Sam runs one Claude Project per hub plus a separate "hub index" Project for
cross-hub/UI work. A change made in the index Project (e.g. adding the Active
Recall tab and the shared widget) can silently collide with a change made the
same week in a single hub's own Project (e.g. mining a new lecture transcript
into Hepatobiliary), because neither session has any way to know the other
ran. There's no mechanism to make Claude Projects "talk to each other" — the
fix is procedural: treat this repo as the single source of truth, always
re-pull before you push, and put anything cross-hub here or in `widget/`
instead of copy-pasted into individual hubs.
